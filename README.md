<h2>üë®‚Äçüíª Data Analyst & Data Science Projects:</h2>

- <b>Machine Learning Project using Python</b>
  - [Comparing Supervised Learning Performance](https://github.com/farhanulf/Machine-Learning-using-Python/tree/main#readme)

  <b>Overview </b>
  - The project aims to identify the most effective model for predicting the desired outcome. The insights gained from this analysis can guide decision-making and provide valuable recommendations for future applications in similar domains.
  - To ensure robust and reliable evaluations, cross-validation techniques are employed, dividing the data into multiple folds and performing model training and testing across different subsets.
  - Involves a comprehensive analysis of multiple supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and Random Forest.
  - The project also considers data preprocessing steps, such as handling class imbalance and feature selection, to optimize the models' predictive capabilities.

- <b>SQL Project</b>
  - [Business Report](https://github.com/farhanulf/Business_Report/tree/main#readme)
 
  <b>Overview </b><br>
  
  The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive business report for stakeholders that provides valuable insights and analysis. The report aims to offer a deep understanding of the company's operations and performance by utilizing data querying techniques, website performance analysis, and relevant financial metrics.

  The project involves the following key aspects:
  - Data Querying using the "Big 6" Statements and Clauses: The report utilizes SQL queries to extract essential information from the company's databases.
  - Grouping by with Aggregate Functions: The report incorporates the use of GROUP BY and aggregate functions, such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MAX, to generate meaningful insights from the data.
  - Querying Multiple Tables: In scenarios where data is distributed across multiple tables, the report employs SQL joins and appropriate query techniques to combine and analyze data from different sources.
  - Analyzing Website Performance: The report includes an analysis of the company's website performance using relevant metrics, such as page load time, bounce rate, conversion rate, and user engagement.
